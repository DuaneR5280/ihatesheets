# IHATE âš¡ SHEETS

A project for users who prefer alternatives to viewing traditional spreadsheets in For Sale or Trade (FSOT) subreddits.

**ihate_sheets** aims to provide an alternative way to manage, analyze, and view sheets data.

## Overview

**ihate_sheets** looks to extract that data for analyzation but mostly to output it to a better format. I hate viewing FSOT threads and bouncing back and forth for pictures, trying to figure out some user defined look up table, or any other "unique" way the author put a sheet together. Don't even get me started on the sick-o's who paste spreadsheets into docs ðŸ«£.

### Status

This is really just a learning and fun project. I wanted to learn about some new tools and tried implementing them in this project, which is still very much a "WIP" (work in progress). And very likely broken, but working on my machine ðŸ˜‰.

`2025-06-09`: This was taken from a larger project and is still being converted to a stand alone application.
